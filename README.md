Automatic Gesture Recognition in Infants
========================================

This repository hosts the implementation of a gesture recognition model designed to analyze infant movements in video footage. 
The project aims to support research into early language development by providing a tool for identifying and interpreting 
infant gestures.

Features
--------
- Pre-trained Gesture Recognition Model: A machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying gestures in video data.
- Video Preprocessing Utilities: Scripts for preparing video input for the model.
- Evaluation Tools: Metrics and visualization methods to assess the model's performance.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/infant-gesture-recognition.git cd infant-gesture-recognition
```
